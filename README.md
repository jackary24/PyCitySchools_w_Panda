# PyCity Schools

# Overview

In this challenge we were tasked with analyzing test score data for a school district composed of twelve high schools. We looked at percentages of students passing math, those passing reading, and what percentage of students per school are passing both. Afterwards, we went back to the data to remove the 9th graders from Thomas High School due to rumors of cheating on the standardized testing, and ran the original analysis again to see how the results were affected.

Overall we saw slight reductions in the overall reading and math scores of Thomas High School once the suspected 9th grade scores were removed from the data set. This indicates that the 9th graders were scoring at a higher than average level when compared to their older peers at the school, however with such a slight change I would argue that the cheating was not as pervasive as originally thought. 

In fact the reduction in test scores overall had such little impact on the percentages that Thomas High School maintained its spot as number 2 out of the twelve schools. Looking at both math and reading test scores from the unfiltered data we can see that students at Thomas High School, at every grade level, scored roughly 83% in both categories. This lends further credibility to the assertion that cheating was  a much smaller phenomenon among these students. 

Since the population of students attending this highschool at the 9th grade level was so few, the exclusion of their scores also had no significant impact on test scores by school size, or by spending budget. 

# Summary

From our analysis we can see that with the unaltered test scores, the 9th graders at Thomas High School were performing at a slightly higher level than their peers, however any changes in the data is not significant, indicating that the cheating phenomena was not as widespread, if existent at all.
